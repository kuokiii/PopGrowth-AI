PopGrowth AI is an advanced, interactive web application that models and visualizes population growth using differential equations. This project aims to educate users about exponential and logistic growth models, providing deep insights into real-world population dynamics.

üìä Models
PopGrowth AI implements two primary population growth models:

Exponential Growth Model

Formula: P(t) = P‚ÇÄ * e^(rt)
Assumes unlimited resources and constant growth rate
Ideal for modeling populations in early stages or resource-rich environments
Logistic Growth Model

Formula: P(t) = K / (1 + (K/P‚ÇÄ - 1) * e^(-rt))
Accounts for limited resources and carrying capacity
Provides more realistic long-term projections
Where:

P(t) is the population at time t
P‚ÇÄ is the initial population
r is the growth rate
K is the carrying capacity (for logistic growth)
t is the time in years since the initial population
üåü Features
